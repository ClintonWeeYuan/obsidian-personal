# Disicipline And Resilience

There are 5 ways to succeed:

1. Talent
2. Hard Work
3. Different Perspective
4. Process -> setup a life that allows you to achieve all your goals
5. Luck

### How to be resilient and disciplined

1. Shaping the correct environment can increase your resilience. E.g. surrounding yourselves with books to make sure you read.
2. Encountering failure builds resilience. (Don't make your children's lives too easy)
3. Patience. The more you do something, the easier it will be to continue doing it. "Behaviour breeds behaviour".
