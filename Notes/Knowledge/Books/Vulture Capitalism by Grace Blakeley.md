### Brief Summary
Capitalism isn't defined by free markets or the lack of planning. All capitalist societies contain institutions capable of planning, from large corporations to financial institutions and states.

Capitalism is defined by domination of society by capital. Capital signifies a social relationship, as well as the stuff that defines the relationship. Capitalist societies are divided between a class of people who own stuff (capitalists) and those who are forced to work for a living (workers).


### Chapter 1: How to get away with Murder

Boeing
- Boeing was one of the greatest beneficiaries of corporate welfare in the US, receiving hundreds of millions in grants, subsidies and bailout money.
- In wake of the 737 MAX disasters and the COVID lockdowns, Boeing's collapse was forestalled by US intervention. The CARES Act included $17bn loans for "businesses deemed critical to maintaining national security", of which Boeing was one

The "free market" exerts brutal competitive pressure over those with the least power, while being controlled and manipulated for private gain by those at the top.

### Chapter 2: The United States of Fordlandia

Ford was a privately owned, planned bureaucracy, not unlike the Soviet Union.

They coordinated activities including the development and introduction of new technologies, the design and construction of the necessary production systems, the education of works and consumers, and the gathering of the structure of the capital necessary to power these tasks.

Fordism involved the imposition of some centralized control over the anarchy of the free market.

However, when the firm faced financial difficulties, the US state stepped in to bail them out. Ford's rivals, Chrysler and General Motors, were the greatest recipients of government money during the bailouts that followed the crisis of 2008.

Neoliberal Lie
- What changed under neoliberalism wasn't the size or power of the state, it was who benefited from state intervention. Rather than investing in jobs creating infrastructure investment programs or public services design to support working people, neoliberal states instead handed out unfathomable amounts of cash to big businesses and wealthy individuals claim to promise "free markets"
- The violent and coercive power of the neoliberal state is greater than that of the social democratic state. The violence is exercised for capital, not against it - which is why so few white-collar crimes are ever prosecuted
- Meanwhile, state violence is directed against those least able to resist it - see the dramatic expansion of the US prison population through the prison-industrial complex
- Massive state intervention is not antithetical to capitalism, but the belief that it is serves the interests of the powerful. Dividing the world into capitalist markets and socialist states prevents us from understanding the true nature of the system under which we live: a system defined by rule of capital.
- Although crises did become more frequent with the advent of neoliberalism, this was not because planning had become less prevalent, but because capitalist figured out how to profit from economic booms, while socializing the losses from the busts. During the 2008 crises, workers were forced to bear consequences in the form of unemployment, lower wages and cuts to public services and social security, while bankers who caused the crises ended up with record-breaking bonuses.
