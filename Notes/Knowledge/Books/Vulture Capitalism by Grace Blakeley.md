### Brief Summary
Capitalism isn't defined by free markets or the lack of planning. All capitalist societies contain institutions capable of planning, from large corporations to financial institutions and states.

Capitalism is defined by domination of society by capital. Capital signifies a social relationship, as well as the stuff that defines the relationship. Capitalist societies are divided between a class of people who own stuff (capitalists) and those who are forced to work for a living (workers).


### Chapter 1: How to get away with Murder

Boeing
- Boeing was one of the greatest beneficiaries of corporate welfare in the US, receiving hundreds of millions in grants, subsidies and bailout money.
- In wake of the 737 MAX disasters and the COVID lockdowns, Boeing's collapse was forestalled by US intervention. The CARES Act included $17bn loans for "businesses deemed critical to maintaining national security", of which Boeing was one

The "free market" exerts brutal competitive pressure over those with the least power, while being controlled and manipulated for private gain by those at the top.

### Chapter 2: The United States of Fordlandia

Ford was a privately owned, planned bureaucracy, not unlike the Soviet Union.

They coordinated activities including the development and introduction of new technologies, the design and construction of the necessary production systems, the education of works and consumers, and the gathering of the structure of the capital necessary to power these tasks.

Fordism involved the imposition of some centralized control over the anarchy of the free market.

However, when the firm faced financial difficulties, the US state stepped in to bail them out. Ford's rivals, Chrysler and General Motors, were the greatest recipients of government money during the bailouts that followed the crisis of 2008.

Neoliberal Lie
- What changed under neoliberalism wasn't the size or power of the state, it was who benefited from state intervention. Rather than investing in jobs creating infrastructure investment programs or public services design to support working people, neoliberal states instead handed out unfathomable amounts of cash to big businesses and wealthy individuals claim to promise "free markets"
- The violent and coercive power of the neoliberal state is greater than that of the social democratic state. The violence is exercised for capital, not against it - which is why so few white-collar crimes are ever prosecuted
- Meanwhile, state violence is directed against those least able to resist it - see the dramatic expansion of the US prison population through the prison-industrial complex
- Massive state intervention is not antithetical to capitalism, but the belief that it is serves the interests of the powerful. Dividing the world into capitalist markets and socialist states prevents us from understanding the true nature of the system under which we live: a system defined by rule of capital.
- Although crises did become more frequent with the advent of neoliberalism, this was not because planning had become less prevalent, but because capitalist figured out how to profit from economic booms, while socializing the losses from the busts. During the 2008 crises, workers were forced to bear consequences in the form of unemployment, lower wages and cuts to public services and social security, while bankers who caused the crises ended up with record-breaking bonuses.
### Chapter 3: Disaster Capitalism

The outcome of the 2008 financial crises and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, showed that the rich and powerful are shielded from the consequences of their own risky investments. It is the rest of us who bear the consequences.
- Through Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), $800 billion was distributed to businesses.
	- Only 25% of it were received by workers, rest went to business owners
	- Politicians seeking releections received donations from companies that received PPP loans
	- Rather than bearing consequences of the crises they created, these actors shift the costs of their greed to those with the least power (the working people)
- During COVID, S&P 500 companies spent $882bn, up from $520 bn in 2019, on share buybacks.
	- During that period, ILO estimated that 114 million people lost their jobs
	- In the UK, number of billionaires reached a record high, and 24 more became billionaires.
	- In Europe, billionaire wealth increased by $1 trillion over the pandemic.

AIG 
- Executives at JPMorgan were found to have packaged shoddy mortgages into securities that did not meet its credit standards and sold them off to investors. They even fired the whistleblower who figured it out.
- There are institutions which are meant to protect the stability of the system. But during moments of crises, these institutions are too slow and unwieldy to function effectively. Senior politicians will often bring representatives of the private sector together in a room to develop a solution. This is not a bug, but a feature of capitalism, where it is a system defined by a tension between markets and planning, inn which some actors are able to exert control over the system better than others. 

McKinsey
- During COVID-19, awarded UK Government contract to oversee the Test and Trace program. Unsurprising given that the Tory peer chosen to head the program was a former McKinsey consultant.
- The prize for McKinsey wasn't the payout, but the access to UK citizens' personal data.
- McKinsey's involvement failed to help or actively impeded the response to COVID-19 inn many of its projects.
	- For Veteran Affairs (VA) UK, it took precious weeks to compile the data required to launch the program, causing confusion and delaying rollout.
	- In Florida, McKinsey's support amounted compiling data and putting it in pretty fonts
- When Saudi Arabia hired McKinsey to assess public reaction to the kingdom's austerity measures in 2015, McKinsey wrote a report citing 3 Twitter users who were driving the negative reactions. Those 3 were imprisoned.
- McKinsey advised Purdue Pharma on how it could "turbocharge" sales of the highly competitive drug OxyContin, as well as how the company might push back against regulators attempting to limit the use of the drug.

The capitalist state doing more does not mean socialism. More often than not, it is just a rescue package for the capitalist class.

The Media and Climate Change
- The Economist and Financial Times wrote that some level of state intervention was necessary to curb climate change -> which many saw as an admission of the failings of capitalism.
- These magazines have acted as the journals through which the ruling class debates, discusses and coordinates its approach to the management of capitalist societies.
- Their pleas for central planning are not an admission that capitalism is failing, but they merely recognise that all capitalist societies require some degree of central planning to function.
- Not only is the planet getting warmer, but the rate of change is accelerating. Global surface temperatures increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period since the last 2000 years.
- Humans have disrupted the nitrogen cycle through the overuse of chemical fertilizers that have compromised the quality of our drinking water and the air we breathe. The overuse of antibiotics led to emergence of resistant strains of many potentially deadly bacteria, and the overuse of pesticides have resulted in pollinator decline that is putting at least $600m in global crops at risk each year. Up to 40% of the Earth is now unusable.

### Chapter 4: American-made Sweatshops

Amazon accounts for more than half of all computer and consumer electronics ecommerce sales and 80% of books, music and video sales.
- AWS is by far the most profitable part of the company, accounting for 75% of total operating profit
- Rather than cornering one market, and using its power to hike prices, Amazon seeks constant expansion, using its market power to cut prices and operate at a loss to expand customer base.
- Market power is precisely the power to avoid the pressures imposed by the market. It is the power to control the market, rather than being controlled by it.

Amazon's Influence over politics:
- In 2017 in Seattle, Amazon donated $345,000 to mayoral campaign of Jenny Durkan, whose opponent spoke out against Amazon's monopoly power
- In 2013, Bezos bought the Washington post, appointed a new CEO, and changed the paper's business model. He has used this paper to push back against criticism over wages and working conditions

Black Box Business
- Schumpter argued that "creative destruction" limits the power of the boss over the worker. In his model, if a corporation didn't play the free-market game, over the long run it would die. 
- In reality, big corporations don't die even when (as with Boeing or Ford) they make big mistakes. They can even use excess profits to erect barriers to entry, or simply buy up smaller competitors.
- Even if they find themselves vulnerable during a crisis, powerful firms exploit their close relationship with states to secure bailouts

Chemical Imbalances
- 3 Companies control nearly 70% of the world's agrochemical industry and 60% of the world's commercial seeds, protected by strict intellectual property rules.
- Union Carbide India Ltd was responsible for the Bhopal gas tragedy in India, a terrible industrial disaster.
- Monsanto produces Roundup, which contains glyphosate, a chemical that WHO warned is linked to cancer.
- Dupont knew about the harmful effects of Teflon, but continued to dump the toxic waste into local waterways.
- Google, Amazon + Microsoft have bought 436 companies/startups between them in the past 10 years, and regulators have not challenged any of them


### Chapter 5: Buying Time: How Big Banks Plan


How Businesses Survive
- Financial institutions lend to and invest in businesses, determining how fast certain companies grow, and which ones survive. 
- The planning power of modern finance is not used in the public interest. Instead, it is used by a close network of corporate and financial executives to generate profits for themselves and shareholders.

Wework
- Adam Neuman, CEO of WeWork, committed several terrible financial decisions on behalf of the company for his own benefit:
	- He bought several of the buildings WeWork was leasing, meaning company was paying him a significant rental incom.
	- He also took out several personal loans from the company at low interest rates.
	- He trademarked the word "we" and sold it to the company for $3.9 billion in stock options
- After WeWork's poor financial accounting came to light, and their IPO failed, Neuman still walked away with $1.6 billion.
- Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank invested billions of dollars into the company, and used their clout to keep the company afloat. Had they not stepped in, the company would have failed faster (as the free market would have it)

Madoff
- In 2009, he was sentenced to 150 years in prison for operating the largest Ponzi schema in US history. He defrauded investors to the tune of $64.8 billion.
- JPMorgan was Madoff's bank. Despite being aware of some incongruities in Madoff's financial arrangements, they didn't make the authorities aware of the potential fraud until the last possible moment.
- Madoff himself stated in an interview from prison that JPMorgan knew about the fraud.
- The bank paid $2.6 billion in fines and penalties, including forfeiting $1.7 billion

Black Rock
- World's largest asset manager, controls more than $10 trillion in assets. One of the Big Three asset managers -- BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street -- is the largest shareholder in around 88% of S&P500 companies.
- Investors are supposed to pay attention to decisions made by a company's senior managers. Good managers are rewarded while bad ones are punished. However, BlackRock can't punish managers because it can't sell its shares. The firm's stakes in companies like Walmart and Amazon are too large to off-load, and in any case, BlackRock's market-tracking funds are always going to be heavily invested in the largest corporations. Almost regardless of how these firms perform, they can rely on the fact that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street won't sell their shares.
- President Biden brought several former BlackRock executives into his cabinet.
- The Fed's interventions have also benefited BlackRock, e.g. by providing bailouts for corporations in which the company has substantial stakes.
- Rather than efficient financial markets that allocate investment based on the best available information, a few giant unwieldy organisations that act as the "new permanent owners" of the world's largest corporations and the infrastructure upon which we all depend.
- One paper shows that 3/4 of the world's 205 largest firms by sales are linked to a single global company network of concentrated ownership ties.

### Chapter 6: Capital's Cronies: How States Plan

Exxon:
- In 2000, Exxon released an ad casting doubt on the impact of human activity on the climate (its profits were around $17.7 billion)
- Since 1998, company spent $290 million lobbying the US government.
- Between 1998 and 2014, the company spent around $30 million funding "shadow groups" that spread misinformation about climate breakdown.
- Democratic Senator Joe Manchin blocks almost all progressive legislation, particularly on climate. His personal investments in fossil-fuel companies net him an income of 0.5 million dolalrs/year

The Highway Code
- Hayek uses the metaphor of the "Highway Code". The neoliberal state can lay down the rules of the road, but it cannot tell people where to go once it has done so. The most important aspect of the game is that prior to the playing of the game, outcomes are uncertain for everyone.
- Problem with this code is that it does not tell us about what the state is, how it works, or who makes the rules.

Double Standards
- US policymakers have consistently failed to take action against mergers which would hurt competition and drive up prices. Milton Friedman even argued that antitrust laws tend to undermine competition.
- When it came to labour market, more flexible nostrums were adopted. Breaking up unions on the basis that they promote anticompetitive practices in the labour market is Neoliberalism 101.
- These different attitudes towards competition reflect the different balance of power within each society. US lawmakers, under the influence of powerful lobbyist, have given free rein to large multinational companies.

Greensill
- Company provides supply chain financing. They pay a company's outstanding invoices, and collect payment on those invoices plus interest from the company in the future. 
- They borrowed a tonne of money from Credit Suisse. But when CS faced financial troubles during the pandemic, Greensill was in trouble as their line of credit was drying up. 
- Masayoshi Son stepped in to inject $1.5 billion into CS, on the agreement that CS only lend to Greensill Capital. In return, Greensill lent generously to many of the firms SoftBank had a stake.
- Greensill applied to the Bank of England's CCCF (emergency pandemic loan scheme through which the bank purchased the debt of several large corporations), but were rejected on the grounds that firms that lend out $ to other firms were ineligible. David Cameron texted then chancellor Rishi Sunak and several of his senior advisers, lobbying them to pressure the bank to change the rules governing the scheme.

States do not simply shape the "rules of the game" for economic actors based on the neutral and objective advice of professional economists. State power is itself shaped by the influence of the parties to that game. This doesn't just mean that the rules are written to favour some over others, it means that states will very frequently intervene in that game in service of capital.
