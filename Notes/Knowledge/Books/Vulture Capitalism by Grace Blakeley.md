### Brief Summary
Capitalism isn't defined by free markets or the lack of planning. All capitalist societies contain institutions capable of planning, from large corporations to financial institutions and states.

Capitalism is defined by domination of society by capital. Capital signifies a social relationship, as well as the stuff that defines the relationship. Capitalist societies are divided between a class of people who own stuff (capitalists) and those who are forced to work for a living (workers).


### Chapter 1: How to get away with Murder

Boeing
- Boeing was one of the greatest beneficiaries of corporate welfare in the US, receiving hundreds of millions in grants, subsidies and bailout money.
- In wake of the 737 MAX disasters and the COVID lockdowns, Boeing's collapse was forestalled by US intervention. The CARES Act included $17bn loans for "businesses deemed critical to maintaining national security", of which Boeing was one

The "free market" exerts brutal competitive pressure over those with the least power, while being controlled and manipulated for private gain by those at the top.

### Chapter 2: The United States of Fordlandia

Ford was a privately owned, planned bureaucracy, not unlike the Soviet Union.

They coordinated activities including the development and introduction of new technologies, the design and construction of the necessary production systems, the education of works and consumers, and the gathering of the structure of the capital necessary to power these tasks.

Fordism involved the imposition of some centralized control over the anarchy of the free market.

However, when the firm faced financial difficulties, the US state stepped in to bail them out. Ford's rivals, Chrysler and General Motors, were the greatest recipients of government money during the bailouts that followed the crisis of 2008.

Neoliberal Lie
- What changed under neoliberalism wasn't the size or power of the state, it was who benefited from state intervention. Rather than investing in jobs creating infrastructure investment programs or public services design to support working people, neoliberal states instead handed out unfathomable amounts of cash to big businesses and wealthy individuals claim to promise "free markets"
- The violent and coercive power of the neoliberal state is greater than that of the social democratic state. The violence is exercised for capital, not against it - which is why so few white-collar crimes are ever prosecuted
- Meanwhile, state violence is directed against those least able to resist it - see the dramatic expansion of the US prison population through the prison-industrial complex
- Massive state intervention is not antithetical to capitalism, but the belief that it is serves the interests of the powerful. Dividing the world into capitalist markets and socialist states prevents us from understanding the true nature of the system under which we live: a system defined by rule of capital.
- Although crises did become more frequent with the advent of neoliberalism, this was not because planning had become less prevalent, but because capitalist figured out how to profit from economic booms, while socializing the losses from the busts. During the 2008 crises, workers were forced to bear consequences in the form of unemployment, lower wages and cuts to public services and social security, while bankers who caused the crises ended up with record-breaking bonuses.
### Chapter 3: Disaster Capitalism

The outcome of the 2008 financial crises and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, showed that the rich and powerful are shielded from the consequences of their own risky investments. It is the rest of us who bear the consequences.
- Through Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), $800 billion was distributed to businesses.
	- Only 25% of it were received by workers, rest went to business owners
	- Politicians seeking releections received donations from companies that received PPP loans
	- Rather than bearing consequences of the crises they created, these actors shift the costs of their greed to those with the least power (the working people)
- During COVID, S&P 500 companies spent $882bn, up from $520 bn in 2019, on share buybacks.
	- During that period, ILO estimated that 114 million people lost their jobs
	- In the UK, number of billionaires reached a record high, and 24 more became billionaires.
	- In Europe, billionaire wealth increased by $1 trillion over the pandemic.

AIG 
- Executives at JPMorgan were found to have packaged shoddy mortgages into securities that did not meet its credit standards and sold them off to investors. They even fired the whistleblower who figured it out.
- There are institutions which are meant to protect the stability of the system. But during moments of crises, these institutions are too slow and unwieldy to function effectively. Senior politicians will often bring representatives of the private sector together in a room to develop a solution. This is not a bug, but a feature of capitalism, where it is a system defined by a tension between markets and planning, inn which some actors are able to exert control over the system better than others. 

McKinsey
- During COVID-19, awarded UK Government contract to oversee the Test and Trace program. Unsurprising given that the Tory peer chosen to head the program was a former McKinsey consultant.
- The prize for McKinsey wasn't the payout, but the access to UK citizens' personal data.
- McKinsey's involvement failed to help or actively impeded the response to COVID-19 inn many of its projects.
	- For Veteran Affairs (VA) UK, it took precious weeks to compile the data required to launch the program, causing confusion and delaying rollout.
	- In Florida, McKinsey's support amounted compiling data and putting it in pretty fonts
- When Saudi Arabia hired McKinsey to assess public reaction to the kingdom's austerity measures in 2015, McKinsey wrote a report citing 3 Twitter users who were driving the negative reactions. Those 3 were imprisoned.
- McKinsey advised Purdue Pharma on how it could "turbocharge" sales of the highly competitive drug OxyContin, as well as how the company might push back against regulators attempting to limit the use of the drug.

The capitalist state doing more does not mean socialism. More often than not, it is just a rescue package for the capitalist class.

The Media and Climate Change
- The Economist and Financial Times wrote that some level of state intervention was necessary to curb climate change -> which many saw as an admission of the failings of capitalism.
- These magazines have acted as the journals through which the ruling class debates, discusses and coordinates its approach to the management of capitalist societies.
- Their pleas for central planning are not an admission that capitalism is failing, but they merely recognise that all capitalist societies require some degree of central planning to function.
- Not only is the planet getting warmer, but the rate of change is accelerating. Global surface temperatures increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period since the last 2000 years.
- Humans have disrupted the nitrogen cycle through the overuse of chemical fertilizers that have compromised the quality of our drinking water and the air we breathe. The overuse of antibiotics led to emergence of resistant strains of many potentially deadly bacteria, and the overuse of pesticides have resulted in pollinator decline that is putting at least $600m in global crops at risk each year. Up to 40% of the Earth is now unusable.

### Chapter 4: American-made Sweatshops

Amazon accounts for more than half of all computer and consumer electronics ecommerce sales and 80% of books, music and video sales.
- AWS is by far the most profitable part of the company, accounting for 75% of total operating profit
- Rather than cornering one market, and using its power to hike prices, Amazon seeks constant expansion, using its market power to cut prices and operate at a loss to expand customer base.
- Market power is precisely the power to avoid the pressures imposed by the market. It is the power to control the market, rather than being controlled by it.
