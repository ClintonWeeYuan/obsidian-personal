## Chapter Summary

### Chapter 1: Market Driven Model (US)
In order to promote technological progress, the US adopts the purely hands-off approach. Their belief is that private companies are the best actors to solve technological problems.

The tech sector frequently lobby the government for even less regulation.

Examples:
- Section 230 Communications Decency Act (CDA) protects internet platforms from being held liable for content posted by users. 

Cybersecurity Issues
- Slow in tackling cybersecurity threats. US authorities have no authority to tap into private networks and data centres.
- Being the most technologically advanced country, US is usually the target of such attacks, as they have more valuable data. The Lazarus Group's attack on Sony.

Not entirely market driven:
- US also takes part in incentivizing technological growth, by sponsoring and subsidizing cutting edge research and backing startups.

### Chapter 2: State Centric Model (China)
China's main goals are:
1. Maintaining social stability
2. Economic Growth
3. Technological Supremacy/Self-sufficiency

They keep a firm grip on the country's tech sector in order to achieve these goals. 
- State surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and other tools used to control the population, are all enhanced via digitalization.
	- See propaganda on COVID (portray China's policies as effective, while downplaying role in spreading the virus)
	- See surveillance on Uighur community -> most surveiled community in the world.
- The Great Firewall prevents locals from accessing banned sites (e.g. Google and Twitter) which might contain views that contradict the CCP's values.
- Foreign companies are forced to abide by strict rules in order to be given access to the huge Chinese market. E.g. IBM was forced to share trademark secrets with local competitors in order to open offices in China. Google has a separate site just for China.

> Note on competition: Even though protectionism usually hinders innovation, there is enough domestic competition such that local companies are still forced to innovate, despite there being little foreign competition.

### Chapter 3: Rights Centric Model (Europe)
Europe views technology as a tool for improving people's lives. State therefore has to play a crucial role in regulating the dissemination of such technologies

Examples:
1. Right to Be Forgotten
   - ECJ granted claimant's request for Google to delist stories about him from search engine
2. AI 
3.
