## Chapter Summary

### Chapter 1: Market Driven Model (US)
In order to promote technological progress, the US adopts the purely hands-off approach. Their belief is that private companies are the best actors to solve technological problems.

The tech sector frequently lobby the government for even less regulation.

Examples:
- Section 230 Communications Decency Act (CDA) protects internet platforms from being held liable for content posted by users. 

Cybersecurity Issues
- Slow in tackling cybersecurity threats. US authorities have no authority to tap into private networks and data centres.
- Being the most technologically advanced country, US is usually the target of such attacks, as they have more valuable data. The Lazarus Group's attack on Sony.

Not entirely market driven:
- US also takes part in incentivizing technological growth, by sponsoring and subsidizing cutting edge research and backing startups.

### Chapter 2: State Centric Model (China)
China's main goals are:
1. Maintaining social stability
2. Economic Growth
3. Technological Supremacy/Self-sufficiency

They keep a firm grip on the country's tech sector in order to achieve these goals. 
- State surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and other tools used to control the population, are all enhanced via digitalization.
	- See propaganda on COVID (portray China's policies as effective, while downplaying role in spreading the virus)
	- See surveillance on Uighur community -> most surveiled community in the world.
- The Great Firewall prevents locals from accessing banned sites (e.g. Google and Twitter) which might contain views that contradict the CCP's values.
- Foreign companies are forced to abide by strict rules in order to be given access to the huge Chinese market. E.g. IBM was forced to share trademark secrets with local competitors in order to open offices in China. Google has a separate site just for China.

> Note on competition: Even though protectionism usually hinders innovation, there is enough domestic competition such that local companies are still forced to innovate, despite there being little foreign competition.

### Chapter 3: Rights Centric Model (Europe)
Europe views technology as a tool for improving people's lives. State therefore has to play a crucial role in regulating the dissemination of such technologies

Examples:
1. Right to Be Forgotten
   - ECJ granted claimant's request for Google to delist stories about him from search engine
2. Democracy and Freedom of Speech
   - Disinformation increases polarization and undermines democratic processes by tampering with the electorates' world view.
   - However, banning disinformation would undermine freedom of speech, which itself is central to a democracy.
   - Digital Services Act 2022 requires large platforms (e.g. Google and Facebook) to employ effective content moderation strategies aimed at reducing the spread of disinformation (e.g. by demonetizing disinformation, providing alternative resources, fact-checking posts)
3. Redistribution of Wealth
	1. Antitrust Law
		- Google Shopping case -> ECJ found Google to have abused its market position by prioritizing its own goods/services on its search engine
		- Digital Markets Act 2022 -> targets digital gatekeepers (i.e. platforms with large market share)
	2. Digital Taxes -> digital platforms contribute their fair share to society
	3. Employment protections for digital workers -> European courts have recognised platform workers as employees, and therefore deserve the corresponding benefits/protections

Drive for Technological Autonomy
- In 1980's, 40% of semiconductors were produced in Europe. Now its only 3%. Today, 80% of chips are manufactured in Asia.
- Lithium (an important component in batteries) are mostly found in Asia.
- Europe aims to increase their market share of these vital digital ingredients by 2030.
- Europe also aims to decrease their reliance on American tech giants like Google and Facebook.


Friction between Member States
- Despite the EU's strict stance on tech regulation, enforcement and implementation of those rules differ across member state lines.
- Member states have different opinions as to the right balance between competing rights/interests. 
	- E.g. France is more lenient when it comes to data privacy, and allows security agencies to override this right in the name of "national security". This could be due to recent history, where France suffered multiple terrorist attacks.
- Despite this friction, the author argues that this ultimately results in a more well rounded EU rights regime, as member states have to make compromises on their policy objectives, in order to accommodate differing views.
	- I don't necessarily agree. It seems to water down EU regulation, as different states will creatively interpret (or downright ignore) certain rules. And if a rule is made that accommodates everyone's opinion, it is likely to be a rule that doesn't do much.

### Chapter 4: Vertical Battles 

Companies that operate across different digital regimes have the arduous task of accommodating the conflicting/incompatible regulations in these regimes.
- Apple compromised on its free speech and intellectual property rules to be given access to Chinese markets.
- Google, in 2006, created a search engine that was allowed in China (due to it succumbing to censorship rules imposed by the CCP), but later found this untenable. Project Dragonfly (a later project) which was supposed to be a search engine compatible in China was also terminated in 2019 due to backlash from employees/customers of Google.


Chinese companies operating in US also face the same problem
- In order to be listed in the NYSE, Chinese companies (Didi, TikTok) have to agree to share data with American regulators, but are often required by law to keep such information confidential by Chinese rules
- When Didi got listed in the US without waiting for Chinese approval (cybersecurity reviews), it was fined and asked to delist from NYSE. Its shares plummeted overnight.
- Trump banned Tiktok, signing concerns that user data was being shared with the Chinese government. The order gave Tiktok some time to find a buyer for the US subsidiary, but Chinese regulators responded by making it illegal for Tiktok to sell their technology to foreign companies. Essentially leaving Tiktok between a rock and a hard place.


### Chapter 5:  Horizontal Battle (China vs US)

The battle over digital supremacy between China and the US has been heating up. US claims their actions are required to curtail a belligerent China who u


US actions against China
1. Limiting export of US technology to China
  - Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) enforces rules around the transfer of technologies which are critical national security (AI, quantum computing).
  - BIS also uses the Entity List to block sale of computing resources (e.g. semiconductors) to a select number of Chinese companies.
2. Limiting inflows of Chinese technology and investment into the US
   - Huawei was banned from installing its 5G network infrastructure in the US, due to concerns about the CCP having access to the data flowing through said network.
   - Huawei is very close to the CCP, receiving huge government subsidies that allow it to underbid its competitors by over 30%. Some commentators say that the price they charge does not even cover their production cost.
   - US also attempting to convince other countries to do the same, but third world countries who benefit most from this affordable 5G technology are less concerned (e.g. Malaysia)
3. Decoupling of human capital
  - US has banned certain prominent Chinese researchers/scientists, due to a concern that they will transfer their knowledge back to the CCP
  - However, this might be counterproductive as Chinese immigrants make up a decent portion of the intellectual power of the US. 30% of top AI researchers come from China, and most stay in the US after finishing their studies.
4. Sanctions in response to cybersecurity concerns
  - US imposed sanctions on China, accusing them of committing certain high profile cybercrimes against US companies (e.g. Microsoft)

### Chapter 7: The Waning Global Influence of American Techno-Libertarianism

Big Tech companies in the US reflect the "Californian ideology" and the American techno-libertarian instincts, exporting within their products and services the values of tech US market-driven regulatory model.
- E.g. US requested Twitter to delay its scheduled network maintenance during the 2009 Iran protests surrounding the country's presidential election, in order to prevent any interference with the Iranian protestors' ability to communicate with each other and the outside world.

US government's freedom agenda have also been occasionally undermined by its own tech companies that are eager to pursue profits in foreign markets
- E.g. Narus (a company owned by Boeing) sold technology that was deployed by oppressive governments in the Middle East and North Africa against democracy activists.
- E.g. Cisco Systems provided hardware that China uses to monitor and censor the internet
- E.g. Facebook provided a platform for racist attacks and thus facilitating ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. Rohingya is now suing Meta for over Â£130bn for its role in enabling genocide.
- Bonus: Trump has also threatened to institute policies at home that resemble those deployed by authoritarian regimes. He suggested he had the power to shut down social media companies.

The EU's response to US Big Tech's increase in power was to unleash a wave of regulation:
- New laws on antitrust, data privacy, online copyright, AI, digital taxation, content moderation, platform work and more.

Uncensored platforms did not simply produce freedom as the early American techno-optimist view had predicted. Instead, they also cultivated an online public square littered with hatred, violence and disinformation.


### Chapter 8: Exporting China's Digital Authoritarianism
China has spread its influence over the global digital economy primarily through its tech companies that build core digital infrastructure in different jurisdiction.
- Hardware and Telecoms equipment (Huawei and ZTE)
- Cloud Services, e-commerce platforms and social media platforms (Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance)

Digital Silk Road (DSR) is component of the Chinese government's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a global infrastructure-driven development strategy and a centerpiece of China's foreign policy.
- Export-Import Bank of China financed 85% of the Pakistan-China Fiber Optic Project and gave Nigeria a loan for the 5G network that Huawei built in the country
- In 2018, AZTE was reported to be installing mobile networks, and other digital infrastructure (data storage, analysis services, surveillance capabilities) to cities in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Sudan.
- Huawei has installed telecom networks in about 40 African countries
- Serbian government have cooperated closely to install thousands of smart surveillance cameras in the country
- Many developing countries view Chinese infrastructure as the most affordable path toward digital development, which is key to their economic growth

By exporting digital infrastructure, Chinese tech companies are also exporting Chinese technical and industrial standards, as those standards are embedded in the networks and equipments that rely on Chinese built technology.

Interesting note on AI and computer vision
- Access to Africa means having access to a population with different facial features -> important advantage in retraining its facial recognition algos to remove existing racial biases
