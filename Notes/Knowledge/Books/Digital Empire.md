## Chapter Summary

### Chapter 1: Market Driven Model (US)
In order to promote technological progress, the US adopts the purely hands-off approach. Their belief is that private companies are the best actors to solve technological problems.

The tech sector frequently lobby the government for even less regulation.

Examples:
- Section 230 Communications Decency Act (CDA) protects internet platforms from being held liable for content posted by users. 

Cybersecurity Issues
- Slow in tackling cybersecurity threats. US authorities have no authority to tap into private networks and data centres.
- Being the most technologically advanced country, US is usually the target of such attacks, as they have more valuable data. The Lazarus Group's attack on Sony.

Not entirely market driven:
- US also takes part in incentivizing technological growth, by sponsoring and subsidizing cutting edge research and backing startups.

### Chapter 2: State Centric Model (China)
China's main goals are:
1. Maintaining social stability
2. Economic Growth
3. Technological Supremacy/Self-sufficiency

They keep a firm grip on the country's tech sector in order to achieve these goals. 
- State surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and other tools used to control the population, are all enhanced via digitalization.
	- See propaganda on COVID (portray China's policies as effective, while downplaying role in spreading the virus)
	- See surveillance on Uighur community -> most surveiled community in the world.
- The Great Firewall prevents locals from accessing banned sites (e.g. Google and Twitter) which might contain views that contradict the CCP's values.
- Foreign companies are forced to abide by strict rules in order to be given access to the huge Chinese market. E.g. IBM was forced to share trademark secrets with local competitors in order to open offices in China. Google has a separate site just for China.

> Note on competition: Even though protectionism usually hinders innovation, there is enough domestic competition such that local companies are still forced to innovate, despite there being little foreign competition.

### Chapter 3: Rights Centric Model (Europe)
Europe views technology as a tool for improving people's lives. State therefore has to play a crucial role in regulating the dissemination of such technologies

Examples:
1. Right to Be Forgotten
   - ECJ granted claimant's request for Google to delist stories about him from search engine
2. Democracy and Freedom of Speech
   - Disinformation increases polarization and undermines democratic processes by tampering with the electorates' world view.
   - However, banning disinformation would undermine freedom of speech, which itself is central to a democracy.
   - Digital Services Act 2022 requires large platforms (e.g. Google and Facebook) to employ effective content moderation strategies aimed at reducing the spread of disinformation (e.g. by demonetizing disinformation, providing alternative resources, fact-checking posts)
3. Redistribution of Wealth
	1. Antitrust Law
		- Google Shopping case -> ECJ found Google to have abused its market position by prioritizing its own goods/services on its search engine
		- Digital Markets Act 2022 -> targets digital gatekeepers (i.e. platforms with large market share)
	2. Digital Taxes -> digital platforms contribute their fair share to society
	3. Employment protections for digital workers -> European courts have recognised platform workers as employees, and therefore deserve the corresponding benefits/protections

Drive for Technological Autonomy
- In 1980's, 40% of semiconductors were produced in Europe. Now its only 3%. Today, 80% of chips are manufactured in Asia.
- Lithium (an important component in batteries) are mostly found in Asia.
- Europe aims to increase their market share of these vital digital ingredients by 2030.
- Europe also aims to decrease their reliance on American tech giants like Google and Facebook.


Friction between Member States
- Despite the EU's strict stance on tech regulation, enforcement and implementation of those rules differ across member state lines.
- Member states have different opinions as to the right balance between competing rights/interests. 
	- E.g. France is more lenient when it comes to data privacy, and allows security agencies to override this right in the name of "national security". This could be due to recent history, where France suffered multiple terrorist attacks.
- Despite this friction, the author argues that this ultimately results in a more well rounded EU rights regime, as member states have to make compromises on their policy objectives, in order to accommodate differing views.
	- I don't necessarily agree. It seems to water down EU regulation, as different states will creatively interpret (or downright ignore) certain rules. And if a rule is made that accommodates everyone's opinion, it is likely to be a rule that doesn't do much.

### Chapter 4: Vertical Battles 

Companies that operate across different digital regimes have the arduous task of accommodating the conflicting/incompatible regulations in these regimes.
- Apple compromised on its free speech and intellectual property rules to be given access to Chinese markets.
- Google, in 2006, created a search engine that was allowed in China (due to it succumbing to censorship rules imposed by the CCP), but later found this untenable. Project Dragonfly (a later project) which was supposed to be a search engine compatible in China was also terminated in 2019 due to backlash from employees/customers of Google.
