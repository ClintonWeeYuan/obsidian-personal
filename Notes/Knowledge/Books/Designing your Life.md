## Chapter Summary

### Chapter 1: Are we there yet?
- Reframe: `Good enough is great`
- Focus on what we have now, and understand that it is good enough.
- Do not get caught up on hedonistic treadmill -> road to unhappiness
- Daily Journal:
	- What have I learnt?
	- What have I initiated?
	- Who have I helped?

### Chapter 2: Reframe the Problem
- Reframing the problem will allow the solution to appear
- Steps to reframe
	1. Remove any emotional biases from the problem statement
	2. Rephrase the problem with "How can I..."
	3. Think about what the root of the problem is
- Go for the Best Actionable Outcome, instead of the Best Theoretical Outcome
	- After narrowing down choices, we'll see that it becomes easier to make a decision


### Chapter 3: Grit
Grit is important in progressing our career. It consists of 4 things:
1. Interest in a particular subject
2. Thoughtful practice, which leads to improvement
3. A feeling of purpose
4. Being hopeful that things will get better

Beyond a certain point, money actually corrupts our interest and natural curiosity for things. Instead, follow what interests and excites you. Solve unique and complex problems.
