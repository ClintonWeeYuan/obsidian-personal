### Summary
Axact is a company that sells fake degrees to users around the world, mainly on first world countries (e.g. Europe and Saudi Arabia).

### The Scam
1. Fake university websites are created, and their courses sold to students looking for a degree/certificate.
2. Additional fees requested from users, who are told they won't be able to graduate unless they pay for this additional course. Sometimes the scammers pretend to be other companies looking to hire them, but request that they take some additional certificates to qualify.

### Legal Repercussions
- Claimants sued the company in the US, but Axact simply hired someone to take the fall, and then have that fall guy disappear.
- Currently still under investigation by Pakistan's FIA
### Other Facts
- From the outside, the scam company looks like any other reputable company, with office buildings, great workplace benefits and a decent pay. They even buy meals for their employees. It is this charm that keeps the scam callers working there, even though they know what they are doing is wrong.
